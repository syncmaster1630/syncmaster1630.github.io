        <ul>

            <li>1 cup Granulated Sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon Brown Sugar</li>
            <li>6 cloves Garlic , Crushed in a press</li>
            <li> 2 tablespoon Grated Fresh Ginger</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon Freshly Ground Black Pepper</li>
            <li>1 3-inch Cinnamon Stick</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Pineapple Juice</li>

            <li>2 tablespoon Cornstarch</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Procedure:</h3>
    <hr/>
    <ul>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>In a small saucepan, combine all ingredients except cornstarch and chicken. Bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and stir until sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. Discard cinnamon stick and mix in ½ cup water.</p>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>Place chicken in a heavy-duty sealable plastic bag. Add soy sauce mixture, seal bag, and turn to coat chicken. Refrigerate for at least an hour, ideally overnight.</p>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>Remove chicken and set aside. Pour mixture into a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low. Mix cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water and add to pan. Stir until mixture begins to thicken, and gradually stir in enough water (about ½ cup) until sauce is the consistency of heavy cream. Remove from heat and set aside.</p>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
            <p>Preheat a broiler or grill. Lightly brush chicken pieces on all sides with sauce, and broil or grill about 3 minutes per side. While chicken is cooking, place sauce over high heat and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a bare simmer, adding water a bit at a time to keep mixture at a pourable consistency. To serve, slice chicken into strips, arrange on plates, and drizzle with sauce.</p>
