    <h2>The Teryaki Chicken</h2>
    <h4>First ...</h4>

        <p>
            First things first: teriyaki is more than just a sauce. It’s actually a cooking technique originating in Japan, involving boiling meat or seafood with a sweet and salty soy glaze. This recipe focuses on the American-style chicken teriyaki you most likely know (and love). It’s a little salty, a little sweet, a little sour, and has just the tiniest hint of spice from minced ginger. The best part? This reliable weeknight dinner takes just about half an hour to make.
