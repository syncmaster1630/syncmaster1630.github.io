    <h3>The Teriyaki Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <p>This simple but amazing teriyaki sauce is great for chicken, fish, or meat dishes. I will add a Japanese flavor to noodle stir fries or rice dishes, and can also be used as a dip for dumplings or shrimp.</p>
        <p>You'll never reach for the store-bought stuff again after making this incredibly tangy, rich, and sweet homemade teriyaki sauce. Enjoy a quick, flavorful glaze, marinade, or dip made with pantry ingredients like soy sauce and brown sugar. Plus, learn about the ingredients needed for an authentic teriyaki sauce, how to make it, and how it's stored.</p>
